# Applied Probability Theory From Scratch

### Code and slides to accompany the online series of webinars: https://data4sci.com/probability by Data For Science.

Recent advances in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence have result in a great deal of attention and interest in these two areas of Computer Science and Mathematics. Most of these advances and developments have relied in stochastic and probabilistic models, requiring a deep understanding of Probability Theory and how to apply it to each specific situation

In this lecture we will cover in a hands-on and incremental fashion the theoretical foundations of probability theory and recent applications such as Markov Chains, Bayesian Analysis and A/B testing that are commonly used in practical applications in both industry and academia

## Schedule
